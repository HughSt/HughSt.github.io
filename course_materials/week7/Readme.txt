Overview
This week we will learn about spatial regression with areal data. On week 6, we reviewed techniques for spatial regression assuming spatial variation as a continuous process. However it is very common to have data aggragated by spatial units (districts, counties, etc.). We will spend some time explaining the concept of Spatial Covariance and its relation with the Varigram, introduced in previous sessions. We will explain how spatial association changes when using areal data and learn how to model it using a Conditional Autoregressive Model.

Concepts to learn:
- Difference between point-level data and areal data
- Spatial Covariance
- Difference between Spatial Covariance and Variogram
- How to define a graph of areal data units
- Conditional Autoregressive Model
