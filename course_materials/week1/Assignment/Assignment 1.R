#1)   # Try creating a plot and a map using the Scottish lip cancer data
      # using the RData file called "Scotland.RData".
      # You can use the 'load' function to load an RData object
      # You will be using this dataset later. The important variables are
      # 'COUNT' - number of cases, "PY" - person years, "EXP" - expected number of cases
      # 'SMR' - Standardized morbidity ratio
      # Make sure you include a legend for the outcome you choose to plot


#2)   # Make a leaflet map using some other interesting  
      # spatial data related to health. This could 
      # be vector or raster data or both. Make
      # sure the map is interpretable on its own
      # i.e. include a legend with a title
      
      # Some ideas for where to get hold of some
