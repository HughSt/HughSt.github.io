## Week 2 - Manipulating spatial data

In week 1, you got to load up some spatial data and make some pretty maps. This week, we will be stepping up a gear and learning how to crop and subset spatial data. We will also be go through the process of resampling rasters.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Clip and subset vector and raster data
- Resample rasters
- Relate spatial data
