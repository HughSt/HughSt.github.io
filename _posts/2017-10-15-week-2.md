\#\# Week 2 - Manipulating spatial data

In week 1, you got to load up some spatial data and make some pretty
maps. This week, we will be stepping up a gear and learning how to crop
and subset spatial data. We will also be go through the process of
resampling rasters.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

  - Clip and subset vector and raster data
  - Resample rasters
  - Relate spatial data
