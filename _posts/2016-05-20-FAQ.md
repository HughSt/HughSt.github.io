## How do I load a shapefile into R?

There are several ways to read in shapefiles into R. Our favourite is the readOGR function in the rgdal package. At minimum you need to specify the folder where the shapefile lives and the name of the shapefile without the .shp file extension. 

```javascript
library(rgdal)
shape_object <- readOGR(dsn = "path to folder with shapefile", layer = "name of shapefile without .shp")
```
